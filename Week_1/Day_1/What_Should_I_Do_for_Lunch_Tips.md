### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the `node` command in Labber.

Work on your code iteratively â€“ that means in small pieces. 

To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.
``` javascript
function WhatToDoForLunch (hungry, availableTime) {
  console.log("hungry is", hungry);
  console.log("Available time is", availableTime);
}
```
